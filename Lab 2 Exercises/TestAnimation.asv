%n is the number of arrows on the plot that are evenly rotated about point
%p,q
n = 5; 
p = 1.5;
q = -4;

%a is the angle between arrows that is determined from n
a = (2*pi)/n

%plot arrows

for k=[1:n]
    drawshape(arrow)
    arrow =


X = rotateabout(arrow, a, p, q)
drawshape(rotateXyNewArrow, 'b')
