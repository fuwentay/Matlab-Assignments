%Finding the acceleration (ms^-2)
% Th (N), M (kg), g (ms^-2) denotes thrust, mass and gravity respectively.
function acceleration = GetAcceleration(thrust, state)
    g = state.g;
    M = state.fuelmass; 
    totalmass = state.fuelmass + state.
    
    %Acceleration from Force Balance
    acceleration = (thrust - M*g)/M;
end
