Aim: Model a Saturn V rocket launch using Euler's Method

1. Initialise the values
1.1 Initialise any rocket constants needed for force formula
1.2 Set the initial value of a, v and h (all zero)
1.3 Set the start and end value of t (0 to 300 seconds), and a step size (0.1)
1.4 Define a vector of time steps called T
1.5 Initialise vectors of zeros to store calculated values (vectors called A,V,H)

2. Repeat for each time step.
    3. Store the current values of a, v and h for plotting later.
    
    4. Calculate the acceleration.
        4.1 Calculate the force acting on the object.
        4.2. Use Newton's second law (F = ma) to find the acceleration.
    
    5. Use Euler's method to find the height at the next step.
        h = h + dt * v

    6. Use Euler's method to find the velocity at the next step.
        v = v + dt * a
7. Plot the data.
