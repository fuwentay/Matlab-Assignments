Fu Wen Tay, 15 May, Exercise 5b: Version 8

The lander simulator and controller

1. Initialise the values.

   1.1 Set the Model Parameters.

   1.2 Initialise vectors to store the data to plot.

2. Repeat for each time step while above the ground.

   3. Store the data to plot later.

   4. Get the thrust from the controller.

      4.1 Set a target velocity for current time step.

      4.2 Find the thrust, based on this target velocity.

   5. Run the simulator to predict what will happen over the next time step.

      5.1 Calculate the acceleration.

          5.1.1 Calculate the total mass.

          5.1.2 Calculate the force.

          5.1.3 Use Newton's second law to calculate the acceleration.

      5.2 Use Euler's method to find the position at the next step.

      5.3 Use Euler's method to find the velocity at the next step.

      5.4 Increase the time by dt.

6. End of repeat.

7. Plot the data.
