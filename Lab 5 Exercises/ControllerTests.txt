Version 7 = Linear Target Velocity Controller, Design Criteria, Variable Mass Model, Variable Drag Model, Run lander.m
- Intercept: 0
- Slope: -0.1/s
- Initial velocity: -300m/s
- Height: 3000m
- Control gain: 1000
- Landing velocity =-0.98147m/s. Criteria #1 Passed!
- Fuel remaining at landing =0kg. Criteria #2 Failed!
- Max Acceleration =22.4101m/s^2. Criteria #3 Passed!
- Behaviour of landing: The height of the of lander seems to follow an exponential decay with time. Meaning that the velocity of the lander decreases with time
  drastically and takes a very long (or even infinitely) long time to touch the ground. Hence, it can be observed that from 40 to 120s, the height of the lander
  has not changed significantly yet it has still not touched the ground. Within that timespan, it has also used more than 500kg of fuel. This is a very poor
  landing logic therefore it failed.

Version 8 = Piecewise Linear Target Velocity Controller, Design Criteria, Variable Mass Model, Variable Drag Model, Run lander.m

- state.Hpoints = [0 1500 3000]    
- state.Vpoints = [-1 -100 -300]
- split: 1500
- gradients: [-0.0660 -0.1333]
- intercepts: [-1 100]
- Initial velocity: -290m/s
- Height: 3100m
- Control gain: 1000

- Fuel remaining at landing =307.6198kg. Criteria #2 Passed!
- Max Acceleration =27.1616m/s^2. Criteria #3 Passed!
- The lander is able to land safely. However, it is observed that it uses more fuel with a Piecewise Linear (PWL) target velocity as compared to the linear model.
  A different pwl that will be better than the linear model can be determined by automatically varying the Hpoints and Vpoints (in turn the split, gradients and intercepts) and
  selecting the values that results in the most fuel remaining if fuel is the priority.

Version 9 = Improved Piecewise Linear Target Velocity Controller (through automated investigation), Design Criteria, Variable Mass Model, Variable Drag Model, Run lander.m

- As a quick recap, our design criteria are:
    1. Touchdown velocity between 0 and -2m/s
    2. Fuel Mass upon landing greater than 0kg.
    3. Maximum acceleration less than 6g.
- Given that all the landers with sVel (Target Velocity (m/s) at Height of 1500m) values between -300 and -100m/s
  have a maximum acceleration under 6g (greatest max acceleration is 37.0489m/s^2 for sVel of -300m/s), all the landers
  pass the criteria of max acceleration.
- It is observed that at a sVel value of greater magnitude (larger negative value), the landing velocity and fuel left is
  also greater. Although a greater amount of fuel left is ideal, our landing velocity cannot exceed 2m/s. 
  Therefore, our landing velocity is our limiting factor and we would choose the value of sVel closest to -2m/s as long
  as it is >= to -2m/s. As such, we will take an sVel value that corresponds to a Landing Velocity value of 1.85m/s which is a safe estimate. 
  This value is -282m/s.

Test for robustness:
- state.Hpoints = [0 1500 3000]    
- state.Vpoints = [-1 -282 -300]
- split: 1500
- Initial velocity: -290m/s

Landing velocity =-1.9738m/s. Criteria #1 Passed!
Fuel remaining at landing =842.8717kg. Criteria #2 Passed!
Max Acceleration =33.7498m/s^2. Criteria #3 Passed!

Given that the value of sVel = -185m/s passed the robustness tests, it is a suitable value for the target velocity at 1500m.
